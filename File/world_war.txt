Magnetic Permeability (μ):
Magnetic permeability measures how easily a material allows magnetic field lines to pass through it.

In other words, it shows how well a material can become magnetized when placed in a magnetic field.

A higher permeability means the material supports the formation of magnetic fields more easily (for example, soft iron).



in a rc coupled bjt amplifier when i have to check the frequency response?
1)without load without bypass capacitor
2)without load with bypass capacitor
3) with load no bypass capacitor
4) with load with bypass capacitor?
